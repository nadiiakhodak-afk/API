PaySaxas supports incoming and outgoing euro-denominated payments through **two SEPA rails**:
- **SEPA Credit Transfer (SEPA CT)**
- **SEPA Instant Credit Transfer (SCT Inst)**

Internal routing, provider logic, reconciliation timing, and AML-specific flows remain strictly internal and are not exposed in the API.

All SEPA transfers follow a **unified transaction model**, a **normalised status lifecycle**, and the same compliance and audit controls.

Manual interventions may occur in exceptional cases (e.g. compliance review, AML flags, document request, return processing)

#### Provider Abstraction Notice

Provider names, routing tables, and SLAs are strictly internal and **never exposed** in public API documentation, payloads, or webhook events.
All SEPA transfers (SEPA CT and SEPA Instant) use a unified PaySaxas schema that abstracts away all underlying providers.

### SEPA IN (Incoming Transfers)

Incoming SEPA credits are automatically created once received from partner banks.
Funds are posted only after ownership validation, screening, and reconciliation.

#### Automated Flow (Standard Route)

Incoming SEPA credits are processed through an automated pipeline that validates account ownership, applies AML screening, and credits funds upon
successful verification.

#### Typical sequence:
Received -> Account Validation -> AML Screening -> Compliance -> Hold (if any) -> Safeguard -> Fee Deduction -> Settled (Completed)

#### Notes:
- Each stage represents an internal transition inside PaySaxas' systems.
- All funds are safeguarded during compliance and settlement checks.
- Completed transfers automatically trigger webhook notifications.
- No provider-level statuses (BICs, internal routing, nodes, channels) are ever exposed

### SEPA OUT (Outgoing Transfers)

Outgoing SEPA transfers follow a unified lifecycle — identical for SEPA CT and SEPA Instant, with differences limited to execution speed and settlement
handling.

#### Automated Flow (Standard Route)

#### Typical sequence:
Payment Created -> AML Screening -> Execution -> Settlement -> Completed

#### Notes:
- Payments are executed under PSD2 and EPC guidelines.
- Failures or rejections automatically update the status lifecycle and trigger webhook notifications.
- Provider-specific codes and routing information are never exposed.
