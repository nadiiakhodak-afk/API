PaySaxas supports incoming (SEPA IN) and outgoing (SEPA OUT) euro-denominated payments through multiple regulated partner rails.
Processing logic and reconciliation flow may vary per rail, but all providers follow the same unified transaction model and API schema.
Internal routing, timing, and provider-level logic remain confidential and are not exposed in API documentation.

All SEPA transfers share the same compliance, audit, and AML controls.
Manual interventions may occur in exceptional cases (e.g., AML hold, compliance review, document request, or return processing).

> Provider Abstraction Notice
> Provider names, routing logic, and SLAs are strictly internal and never exposed in any public documentation, API payload, or
> webhook event.
> All SEPA flows use a unified PaySaxas schema that abstracts underlying providers.
### SEPA IN (Incoming Transfers)


#### Automated Flow (Standard Route)

Incoming SEPA credits are processed through an automated pipeline that validates account ownership, applies AML screening, and credits funds upon
successful verification.

#### Typical sequence:
Received Account Validation AML Screening Compliance Hold (if any) Safeguard Fee Deduction Settled (Completed)

- Each stage represents an internal state transition within the PaySaxas system.
- All funds are safeguarded during compliance screening.
- Completed transactions automatically trigger webhook notifications.
- No manual review occurs unless a compliance flag is raised.
### SEPA OUT (Outgoing Transfers)

**Automated Flow (Standard Route)**

Outgoing SEPA transfers follow an automated lifecycle from order creation to settlement or return.
Each stage ensures AML and regulatory compliance, liquidity validation, and reconciliation.

#### Typical sequence:
Payment Created AML Screening Execution Settlement Completed

- Payments are executed via approved rails under PSD2 and SEPA guidelines.
- Failures or rejections automatically trigger status updates and webhook events.
- No provider-specific data (e.g., BICs, routing nodes) are ever exposed.
