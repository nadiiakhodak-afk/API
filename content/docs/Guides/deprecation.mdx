This section defines the process of retiring old API versions or endpoints.
Deprecation ensures backward compatibility while allowing PaySaxas to introduce new features, improve security, and maintain compliance.

##### Minimum Notice Period

A minimum deprecation notice period of 90 days is provided before any API version or endpoint is retired.
During this period, all existing integrations continue to function normally. Clients are expected to plan migration to the latest version before the announced
sunset date.

##### Communication Channels

All deprecation announcements are delivered through official communication channels:

- Email notifications to registered developers and administrators
- Dashboard or in-app alerts within the client portal
- API response headers indicating deprecation status
- Updates in release notes and API changelog

Each announcement clearly states the affected version or endpoint, the sunset timeline, and the link to the official documentation page with migration
instructions.

##### Deprecation Header Example

When an endpoint is marked for deprecation, API responses include standard HTTP headers:

```http
Deprecation: true
Sunset: Tue, 24 Dec 2025 00:00:00 GMT
Link: <https://docs.paysaxas.com/deprecations>; rel="deprecation"
```

- Deprecation: Indicates that the endpoint or version is scheduled for deprecation.
- Sunset: Specifies the date and time when the deprecated endpoint will be permanently removed.
- Link: Provides a reference to the detailed deprecation notice and migration guide.

##### Deprecation Phases

The deprecation process follows four structured phases to ensure a smooth transition:

- Announcement — The affected endpoint or version is marked as deprecated, and clients are notified via all official channels.
- Support — The deprecated version remains fully operational but receives only critical bug and security fixes.
- Sunset — Limited functionality period. Warnings may appear in API responses, and non-critical support may cease.
- Removal — The version or endpoint is fully disabled and no longer available in production.

##### Client Responsibilities

Clients are expected to:

- Monitor PaySaxas release notes and deprecation announcements regularly.
- Migrate integrations to the latest supported API version before the Sunset phase.
- Update SDKs, webhooks, and internal references to ensure continued compatibility.
- Validate all business-critical flows in staging before switching to the new version.

Failure to migrate before the removal date may result in service interruption for deprecated endpoints.
