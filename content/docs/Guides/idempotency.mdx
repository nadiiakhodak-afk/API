---

To reliably trace operations and prevent accidental duplicate submissions, PaySaxas requires a unique client-supplied request identifier for all write
operations.

#### Header

Each write request must include a unique identifier:

`X-Request-Id: UUIDv4`

> PaySaxas logs each X-Request-Id for traceability and audit purposes.
> The same structure will be used for future idempotent write support.

#### Recommended client practices

- Generate a UUIDv4 per write request (POST, PUT, PATCH, DELETE).
- Do not reuse an ID across different operations or payloads.
- Log and propagate X-Request-Id throughout your systems to enable debugging and monitoring.
- Retry network or timeout errors using a new X-Request-Id.


#### Example
```bash
curl -X POST https://api.paysaxas.com/v1/payments \
-H "Authorization: Bearer <ACCESS_TOKEN>" \
-H "Content-Type: application/json" \
-H "X-Request-Id: 550e8400-e29b-41d4-a716-446655440000" \
-d '{
"debtor_account_id": "acc_123",
"amount": "100.00",
"currency": "EUR",
"reference": "INV-1001",
"counterparty": {
"iban": "FI0212030000000202051",
"name": "ACME Oy"
}
}'
```

> Note:
> Full idempotent behaviour (automatic deduplication of repeated requests with the same X-Request-Id) will be introduced in a later
> API release.
