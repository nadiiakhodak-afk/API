PaySaxas API uses versioning to ensure backward compatibility and predictable integration for all clients.
Each version introduces improvements or new functionality while maintaining stability for existing implementations.

## Versioning strategy

All API endpoints are versioned using a clear and consistent structure (for example, /v1/, /v2/, etc.).
Each version represents a defined stage of the API lifecycle — from initial release to deprecation.

## Specifying the version

Clients specify the API version via the URL path:

`https://api.paysaxas.com/v1/...`

> Only URL-based versioning is supported in PaySaxas API.
> This approach ensures simplicity, transparency, and compatibility across all client environments.


#### Version announcements

New API versions, feature releases, and deprecation timelines are announced via official PaySaxas communication channels, including:

- API documentation changelogs
- Developer newsletters
- Email notifications
- Platform update pages
