API keys are used for server-to-server access to the PaySaxas API.
They allow a client system to authenticate its requests:

```
Authorization: Bearer {API_KEY}
```

API keys are created internally by the PaySaxas team. Clients **do not** create or manage keys through the API.
The platform supports **only Secret API key**. Each newly created key starts with an empty whitelist.

## IP Whitelisting

Each newly created key starts with an empty IP whitelist.
When requesting API keys, the client must include their Whitelisted IP addresses in the request.

Only **IPv4 CIDR** ranges are supported, for example:
- 203.0.113.10/32 — **single IP**
- 203.0.113.0/24 — **network**

For every incoming request:

1. The API key is validated
2. The external IP address of the caller is determined
3. The system checks whether the IP matches any entry in the whitelist

If the IP is not in the whitelist, the request is rejected.

### Error Response (Non-whitelisted IP)

```
HTTP 403 Forbidden
```
```
{
    "error_name": "IP Not Allowed",
    "error_description": "This API key cannot be used from the current IP address.",
    "metadata": {
        "trace_id": "tr_xxxxxxx"
    }
}
```

### Managing the Whitelist

The whitelist is maintained by the PaySaxas team. CIDR entries are added or removed manually. Changes take effect immediately.
