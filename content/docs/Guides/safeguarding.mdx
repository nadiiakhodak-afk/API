Client funds are protected and maintained in segregated safeguarding accounts in accordance with the requirements of the Electronic Money Directive
(EMD2) and the Payment Services Directive (PSD2).
These accounts are fully separated from the company’s operational funds and held with authorised banking partners.

Regular reconciliations and regulatory reports are performed to ensure compliance, accuracy, and transparency in safeguarding processes.
All safeguarding activities are subject to ongoing internal monitoring and external audits in line with applicable regulations.

Internal settlement flows, banking structures, and safeguarding counterparties are confidential and are not disclosed in public documentation
