#### Overview

The Customers API manages individual (B2C) and business (B2B) clients within the PaySaxas ecosystem.
Each customer represents a verified legal entity or natural person and has its own lifecycle, verification flow, and compliance context.

> ***Multi-Entity Access Model***
> A single login (email) can control multiple onboarded profiles:
> - ***Individual*** profile ( type: individual) — verified via KYC.
> - ***Business*** profile(s) (type: business) — verified via KYB.
Each profile receives its own , verification session, accounts, and webhook audit trail. customer_id
Data, accounts, and transactions are isolated per profile and never shared between and business contexts. individual
Switching between profiles in the dashboard changes operational scope only — not data ownership.

### Customer Process Flow & Statuses

This section describes the full lifecycle of a **Customer** within the PaySaxas system — from pre-registration to active client status, including compliance
reviews, rejection cases, and offboarding.
Flows differ for **Individual** and **Business** clients but follow the same regulatory and technical logic.

Lifecycle Separation:

> Individual customers move automatically through verification (auto transitions).
> Business customers require manual actions for each step (manual transitions).
> Each status change generates an auditable event and a webhook notification per customer_id.

### Event Traceability

Each status change triggers an auditable **event** and **webhook** **notification**:
Contains only the unique customer identifier — no PII, statuses, or metadata are exposed.


```json
{
  "id": "cust_92f3e1b9"
}
```

Notes:

- Webhooks contain no PII.
- Signed using HMAC SHA-256 per RFC 2104.
- Delivery retries up to 24h (max 3 attempts).
- All transitions are logged immutably and are auditable by Compliance.

### Naming Convention

> Status values use **lowercase snake_case**.
> type field defines customer flow (individual or business).

```json
{
  "id": "cust_8b29e3",
  "type": "business",
  "status": "compliance_pending",
  "created_at": "2025-10-30T10:31:00Z"
}
```
