title: Webhooks — Transaction Events
---

Webhooks deliver real-time notifications about transaction lifecycle updates.
Each webhook payload contains only the transaction id.
Event type is provided via the header X-Event. After receiving a webhook, always fetch details via the corresponding GET endpoint.

## Supported Events

| Event                 | Description                                                                          |
|-----------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| transaction.created   | Triggered when a new transaction is registered.                                      |
| transaction.completed | Triggered when the transaction is completed and reconciled.                          |
| transaction.failed    | Triggered when the transaction cannot be processed (technical or regulatory reason). |
| transaction.returned  | Triggered when funds are refunded or reversed after rejection.                       |

## Delivery and Headers

Every webhook request includes the following mandatory headers:

| Header       | Example                       | Description                                             |
|--------------|-------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------|
| X-Event      | transaction.created           | Specifies the event type.                               |
| X-Request-Id | req_9a7c4e2f                  | Unique webhook delivery identifier (for deduplication). |
| Date         | Wed, 05 Nov 2025 12:45:30 GMT | UTC timestamp when the webhook was generated.           |
| Content-Type | application/json              | Always application/json.                                |


## Payload Format

Each webhook payload is minimal and contains only one field:
```json
{
    "id": "txn_123456789"
}
```

## Examples

### Transaction Completed
```
POST /webhooks/transactions
X-Event: transaction.created
X-Request-Id: req_9a7c4e2f
Date: Wed, 05 Nov 2025 12:45:30 GMT
Content-Type: application/json
```
```json
{
"id": "txn_123456789"
}
```

## Acknowledgement and Retries

- Your endpoint must respond with any 2xx HTTP status within 5 seconds.
- If no success response is received, the webhook is retried up to 3 times within 24 hours using exponential backoff (1 min 5 min 30 min).
- Use the X-Request-Id value to deduplicate repeated deliveries.

## Security Notes

- Webhooks never include personal, financial, or KYC/KYB data.
- Payloads always contain only the entity id.
- After receiving a webhook, always call GET `/transactions/{id}` to fetch the current state.

## Recommended Handling Flow

1. Receive webhook and verify signature + timestamp.
2. Log X-Event, id, and X-Request-Id.
3. Respond with HTTP 200 or 204.
4. Fetch transactions details via GET `/transactions/{id}`.
5. Apply internal business logic (update CRM, trigger workflows, analytics, etc.).
