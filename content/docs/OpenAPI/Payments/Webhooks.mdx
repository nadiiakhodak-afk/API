title: Webhooks (Payment & Transaction Events)
---

Webhooks deliver real-time notifications about payment or transaction events lifecycle updates.
Each webhook payload contains only the entity id.
Event type is provided via the header X-Event. After receiving a webhook, always fetch details via the corresponding GET endpoint.

## Supported Payment Events

|-------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------|
| payment.created   | A new outgoing payment is accepted for processing.                   |
| payment.completed | The payment is successfully executed and reconciled.                 |
| payment.failed    | The payment could not be processed (technical or regulatory reason). |

## Delivery and Headers

Every webhook request includes the following mandatory headers:

| Header       | Example                       | Description                                                        |

| X-Event      | account.created               | Specifies the event type.                                          |
| X-Request-Id | req_9a7c4e2f                  | Unique webhook delivery identifier (for deduplication).            |
| Date         | Wed, 05 Nov 2025 12:45:30 GMT | UTC timestamp when the webhook was generated.                      |
| Content-Type | application/json              | Always application/json.                                           |


## Payload Format

Each webhook payload is minimal and contains only one field:
```json
{
    "id": "entity_123456789"
}
```

## Examples

### Payment completed
```
POST /webhooks/payments
X-Event: payment.completed
X-Request-Id: req_9a7c4e2f
Date: Wed, 05 Nov 2025 12:45:30 GMT
Content-Type: application/json
```
```json
{
"id": "pay_123456789"
}
```

### Payment returned
```

```

```

### Transaction created (SEPA IN)

## Acknowledgement and Retries

- Your endpoint must respond with any 2xx HTTP status within 5 seconds.
- If no success response is received, the webhook is retried up to 3 times within 24 hours using exponential backoff (1 min 5 min 30 min).
- Use the X-Request-Id value to deduplicate repeated deliveries.

## Security Notes

- Webhooks never include personal, financial, or KYC/KYB data.
- Payloads always contain only the entity id.
- After receiving a webhook, always call GET `/transactions/{id}` or GET `/payments/{id}` to fetch the current state.

## Recommended Handling Flow

1. Receive webhook and verify signature + timestamp.
2. Log X-Event, id, and X-Request-Id.
3. Respond with HTTP 200 or 204.
4. Fetch entity details via GET `/transactions/{id}` or GET `/payments/{id}`.
5. Apply internal business logic (update CRM, trigger workflows, analytics, etc.).
