title: Webhooks — Account & IBAN Events
---

Webhooks deliver real-time notifications about account and IBAN events.
The payload is intentionally minimal — the body contains only the entity id.
Event type is provided via the header X-Event. After receiving a webhook, always fetch details via the corresponding GET endpoint.

## Supported Events

| Event                  | Description                                        | Fetch details              |
|------------------------|----------------------------------------------------|----------------------------|
| account.created        | New account created and activated.                 | `GET /accounts/{id}`       |
| account.reserved       | Account structure reserved (not yet active).       | `GET /accounts/{id}`       |
| account.status.changed | Lifecycle change (inactive reserved active closed) | `GET /accounts/{id}`       |
| account.close          | Account closed (offboarding).                      | `GET /accounts/{id}`       |
| account.changed        | Balance updated after posting.                     | `GET /accounts/{id}`       |
| iban.issued            | A new IBAN issued under the account.               | `GET /accounts/{id}/ibans` |
| iban.updated           | IBAN metadata or status changed.                   | `GET /accounts/{id}/ibans` |

## Delivery and Headers

Every webhook request includes the following mandatory headers:

| Header       | Example                       | Description                                                        |
|--------------|-------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------|
| X-Event      | account.created               | Specifies the event type.                                          |
| X-Request-Id | req_9a7c4e2f                  | Unique webhook delivery identifier (for deduplication).            |
| Date         | Wed, 05 Nov 2025 12:45:30 GMT | UTC timestamp when the webhook was generated.                      |
| Content-Type | application/json              | Always application/json.                                           |


## Payload Format

Each webhook payload is minimal and contains only one field:
```json
{
    "id": "acc_123456789"
}
```

## Examples

### Account created
```
POST /webhooks/accounts
X-Event: account.created
X-Request-Id: req_9a7c4e2f
Date: Wed, 05 Nov 2025 12:45:30 GMT
Content-Type: application/json
```
```json
{
"id": "acc_123456789"
}
```
### Balance changed

```
POST /webhooks/accounts
X-Event: balance.changed
X-Request-Id: req_9a7c4e2f
Date: Wed, 05 Nov 2025 12:45:30 GMT
Content-Type: application/json
```
```json
{
  "id": "acc_987654321"
}
```
### IBAN issued
```
POST /webhooks/accounts
Content-Type: application/json
X-Event: iban.issued
X-Request-Id: req_73fcd
Date: Wed, 05 Nov 2025 13:40:00 GMT
```
```json
{
  "id": "acc_456789123"
}
```
## Acknowledgement and Retries

- Your endpoint must respond with any 2xx HTTP status within 5 seconds.
- If no success response is received, the webhook is retried up to 3 times within 24 hours using exponential backoff (1 min 5 min 30 min).
- Use the X-Request-Id value to deduplicate repeated deliveries.

## Security Notes

- Webhooks never include personal, financial, or KYC/KYB data.
- Payloads always contain only the entity id.
- After receiving a webhook, always call GET `/accounts/{id}` to fetch the current state.

## Recommended Handling Flow

1. Receive webhook and verify signature + timestamp.
2. Log X-Event, id, and X-Request-Id.
3. Respond with HTTP 200 or 204.
4. Fetch accounts details via GET `/accounts/{id}`.
5. Apply internal business logic (update CRM, trigger workflows, analytics, etc.).
