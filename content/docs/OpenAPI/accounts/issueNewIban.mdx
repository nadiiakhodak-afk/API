### Lifecycle & Idempotency
- Each IBAN belongs to one master account and shares its ledger balance.
- An IBAN may be closed (status: closed) but never deleted.
- Always include X-Request-Id (UUIDv4) for idempotency. Repeated requests with the same ID will return the same issued IBAN.
- All issuance operations are logged with timestamp, operator ID, and source IP.
