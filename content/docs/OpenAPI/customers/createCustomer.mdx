          Creates a new customer record — either **individual** or **business**
          — and initializes its lifecycle in the `pre_registration` stage.  
          This is the first step of the customer onboarding process.   After
          creation, lifecycle transitions are handled internally:
            * **Individuals** progress automatically (system-driven flow).
            * **Businesses** progress manually through compliance review in the back office.  
          ⚠️ This endpoint does **not** accept or expose any KYC/KYB data.
