          Retrieves the full details of a specific customer by ID, including
          lifecycle stage, verification status, and metadata.   This endpoint is
          **read-only** — it does not allow modifications to customer data or
          lifecycle state.   Lifecycle transitions depend on internal onboarding
          flow and compliance checks.
