title: Webhooks — Customer Events
---

Webhooks allow your system to receive real-time notifications about customer lifecycle events — such as creation, status changes, or suspension.
Each webhook delivers a minimal payload containing only the customer ID, while the event type is always provided in the header X-Event.

For full customer details, your system must call GET `/customers/{id}` after receiving a webhook.

## Supported Events


| Event                   | Description                                                                                    |
|-------------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| customer.created        | Triggered when a new customer is successfully created via POST /customers.                     |
| customer.status.changed | Triggered when the customer’s lifecycle stage changes (e.g., from pre_registration to active). |
| customer.suspended      | Triggered when a customer is manually suspended or restricted in the back office.              |

Each event is delivered to the webhook URL configured in your partner dashboard.
You can use a single endpoint for all customer events or separate URLs per event type.

## Delivery and Headers

Every webhook request includes mandatory headers for authentication, traceability, and event identification.


| Header       | Example                       | Description                                                        |
|--------------|-------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------|
| X-Event      | customer.created              | Specifies the event type.                                          |
| X-Request-Id | req_9a7c4e2f                  | Unique webhook delivery identifier (for deduplication).            |
| Date         | Wed, 05 Nov 2025 12:45:30 GMT | UTC timestamp when the webhook was generated.                      |
| Content-Type | application/json              | Always application/json.                                           |


Security requirements
- Verify X-Signature using the shared webhook secret.
- Reject requests where the timestamp in Date differs by more than 5 minutes from the current time.
- Do not trust the event type in the URL — always read it from the header X-Event.

## Payload Format

Each webhook payload is minimal and contains only one field:
```json
{
    "id": "cust_123456789"
}
```

## Examples

### Example — `customer.created`
```
POST /webhooks/customers
Content-Type: application/json
X-Event: customer.created
X-Request-Id: req_9a7c4e2f
Date: Wed, 05 Nov 2025 12:45:30 GMT
```
```json
{
"id": "cust_123456789"
}
```
### Example — `customer.status.changed`

```
POST /webhooks/customers
Content-Type: application/json
X-Event: customer.status.changed
X-Request-Id: req_b481aa
Date: Wed, 05 Nov 2025 13:10:02 GMT
```
```json
{
  "id": "cust_987654321"
}
```
### Example — customer.suspended
```
POST /webhooks/customers
Content-Type: application/json
X-Event: customer.suspended
X-Request-Id: req_73fcd
Date: Wed, 05 Nov 2025 13:40:00 GMT
```
```json
{
  "id": "cust_456789123"
}
```
## Acknowledgement and Retries

- Your endpoint must respond with any 2xx HTTP status within 5 seconds.
- If no success response is received, the webhook is retried up to 3 times within 24 hours using exponential backoff (1 min 5 min 30 min).
- Use the X-Request-Id value to deduplicate repeated deliveries.

## Security Notes

- Webhooks never include personal, financial, or KYC/KYB data.
- Payloads always contain only the entity id.
- After receiving a webhook, always call GET `/customers/{id}` to fetch the current state.

## Recommended Handling Flow

1. Receive webhook and verify signature + timestamp.
2. Log X-Event, id, and X-Request-Id.
3. Respond with HTTP 200 or 204.
4. Fetch customer details via GET `/customers/{id}`.
5. Apply internal business logic (update CRM, trigger workflows, analytics, etc.).
