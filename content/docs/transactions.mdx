The Transactions API provides a **read-only canonical model** of all financial movements — incoming and outgoing.
Each transaction belongs to an account, which belongs to a verified customer.

Transactions are immutable ledger entries and safely abstracted from internal provider logic.
The API exposes **a unified normalised transaction structure**, which includes:

- lifecycle status
- full status history
- payment scheme (SEPA, SEPA Instant)
- sender and sender bank details (for incoming payments)
- fee information
- timestamps for creation, receipt, and settlement

### Unified Lifecycle (Abstracted from Provider Workflows)

PaySaxas integrates multiple regulated payment providers.
Each provider (e.g. SEPA IN/OUT gateways) has its own operational and AML flow.

However, the public API exposes **a single unified status model**, reflected in both the `status` field and the `status_history` list

| Status         | Description                                              |
|----------------|----------------------------------------------------------|
| **pending**    | Transfer created and awaiting processing.                |
| **processing** | Under AML, compliance, or operational checks.            |
| **completed**  | Completed and reconciled.                                |
| **failed**     | Could not be processed (technical or regulatory reason). |
| **returned**   | Funds refunded or reversed after rejection.              |

>Internal routing (e.g., AML Review, Finance Freeze, Settlement Exception) is never exposed in API responses.
>Provider-specific transitions are aggregated into these unified statuses.

### Additional Normalised Fields
The canonical transaction model also includes:
- **payment_scheme** — SEPA, SEPA_INSTANT.
- **received_at** — timestamp when funds were received (entry date).
- **settled_at** — timestamp when funds were posted to the account (value date).
- **status_history** — chronological log of lifecycle transitions.
- **sender** and **sender_bank** — structured payer information for incoming transactions.
- **fees** — transaction fee details.
