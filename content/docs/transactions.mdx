The Transactions API provides a read-only history of all financial movements — incoming and outgoing.
Each transaction belongs to an account, which belongs to a verified customer.
Transactions are immutable and safely abstracted from internal provider logic.

### Unified Lifecycle (Abstracted from Provider Workflows)

PaySaxas integrates multiple regulated payment providers.
Each provider (e.g., SEPA IN/OUT gateways, internal ledgers) has its own routing, AML, and exception flow.
However, the public API exposes a single normalised status model:

| Status | Description |
| --- | --- |
| pending | Transaction created and awaiting confirmation. |
| in_progress | Processing by payment rails or internal ledger. |
| completed | Funds successfully settled. |
| failed | Payment rejected or not processed. |
| reversed | Transaction refunded, reversed, or returned. |

> Internal routing (e.g., “AML Review”, “Finance Freeze”, “Settlement Exception”) is never exposed in API responses.
> Provider-specific transitions are aggregated into these unified statuses.

### Endpoints

| Method | Endpoint | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| GET | /transactions | Returns a list of transactions filtered by parameters. |
| GET | `/transactions/{id}` | Returns full transaction details. |

| Method | Endpoint | Link |
| --- | --- | --- |
| GET | /transactions | GET /transactions — List Transactions |
| GET | `/transactions/{id}` | GET `/transactions/{id}` — Retrieve Transaction Details |
