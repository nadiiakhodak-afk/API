The Transactions API provides a **read-only** history of all financial movements — incoming and outgoing.
Each transaction belongs to an account, which belongs to a verified customer.
Transactions are immutable and safely abstracted from internal provider logic.

### Unified Lifecycle (Abstracted from Provider Workflows)

PaySaxas integrates multiple regulated payment providers.
Each provider (e.g., SEPA IN/OUT gateways, internal ledgers) has its own routing, AML, and exception flow.
However, the public API exposes a single normalised status model:

| Status     | Description                                              |
|------------|----------------------------------------------------------|
| pending    | Transfer created and awaiting processing.                |
| processing | Under AML, compliance, or operational checks.            |
| completed  | Completed and reconciled.                                |
| failed     | Could not be processed (technical or regulatory reason). |
| returned   | Funds refunded or reversed after rejection.              |

> Internal routing (e.g., “AML Review”, “Finance Freeze”, “Settlement Exception”) is never exposed in API responses.
> Provider-specific transitions are aggregated into these unified statuses.

### Endpoints

| Method | Endpoint                                                           | Description                       |
|--------|--------------------------------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------|
| GET    | [`/transactions`](../OpenAPI/transactions/listTransactions)        | Returns a list of transactions.   |
