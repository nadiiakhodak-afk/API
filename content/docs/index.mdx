## Introduction

PaySaxas is a Banking-as-a-Service (BaaS) platform that enables fintechs, EMIs, PSPs, and digital businesses to build and launch financial products using a secure, modular infrastructure. The API lets clients onboard customers, open and manage accounts, move money, and automate operational or compliance workflows.

The platform centres around a few core building blocks — customers, accounts, payments, and event notifications — so you can embed financial functionality directly into your product.

## Core Use Cases
- Onboard individual or business customers through a secure, API-driven flow.
- Create and manage customer accounts with dedicated identifiers (IBANs or other supported formats).
- Initiate and track incoming and outgoing payments across supported payment networks.
- Receive asynchronous notifications about account or payment status updates.
- Retrieve balances and transaction history programmatically.

## Key Entities
- **Customer** — an onboarded individual or company operating under your programme.
- **Account** — a ledger account tied to a customer, with balances, statements, and virtual identifiers.
- **Payment** — an outgoing or incoming transaction processed through supported payment rails.

## Typical Flow
1. Authenticate using OAuth 2.1 client credentials.
2. Send a request to the relevant PaySaxas endpoint.
3. Process the synchronous response.
4. Listen for webhooks that confirm status changes.

## Next Steps
- Follow the Quickstart guide to obtain credentials and issue your first API requests.
- Explore the Accounts, Payments, and Confirmation sections for detailed workflows.
- Review the OpenAPI reference for full endpoint definitions.
