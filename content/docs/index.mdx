## Introduction

PaySaxas is a Banking-as-a-Service (BaaS) platform that enables Fintechs, CASPs/VASPs, PSPs and digital businesses to build and launch financial
products using a secure, modular infrastructure. Through the PaySaxas API, clients can onboard customers, open and manage accounts, send and
receive payments, and automate operational and compliance workflows.

The API provides access to several core entities — customers, accounts, payments, transactions, and event notifications — allowing businesses to
integrate financial functionality directly into their own products and services.

## Core Use Cases
- Onboard individual or business customers through a secure, API-driven flow.
- Create and manage customer accounts with dedicated identifiers (IBANs or other supported formats).
- Initiate and track incoming and outgoing payments across supported payment networks.
- Receive asynchronous notifications about account or payment status updates.
- Retrieve balances and transaction history programmatically.

## Key Entities
- **Customer** — represents an onboarded individual or company within the system.
- **Account** — financial account associated with a customer, identified by a unique account reference.
- **Payment (Payment Order)** — an instruction issued by a payer to transfer a specified amount of money to a payee.
- **Transaction** — a completed movement of funds, representing a fully executed payment order once settled within the network.
- **Event notification** — asynchronous update sent to client systems to reflect changes in entity status (for example, when a payment is completed or fails).
