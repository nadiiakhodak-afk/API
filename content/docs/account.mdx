Management of customer accounts.

Each **Account** represents an internal ledger object linked to a verified **Customer** (either Individual or Business).
Accounts are used to hold balances, process payments, and manage compliance-related activity within the PaySaxas ecosystem.

#### Definition

- An Account is a unique financial record within the ledger associated with one verified customer.
- Each account is created in a single currency and has its own lifecycle and identifiers (account ID, vIBAN, status).
- Account types define operational purpose:
    - ***Individual Account*** — created for individual (KYC) clients.
    - ***Business Account*** — created for corporate (KYB) clients.

Relationship:

- One **Customer** many **Accounts** (1:N relationship).
- An account cannot exist without a verified customer.
- Account identifiers are immutable once created.

#### Account Opening — Payloads & Responses

Process for account creation, validation, and lifecycle management.

| Method | Endpoint                                               | Description                                                                                     |
|--------|--------------------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| POST   | [`/accounts`](../OpenAPI/accounts/issueNewIban)        | Creates a new account for a verified customer.                                                  |
| GET    | [`/accounts`](../OpenAPI/accounts/listAccounts)        | Retrieves a list of all accounts associated with the verified customer.                         |
| GET    | [`/accounts/{id}`](../OpenAPI/accounts/getAccountById) | Retrieves detailed information about a specific account (currency, balances, status, metadata). |

#### Lifecycle & Status Flow

| Status   | Description / Trigger                                                                                                                 |

| Reserved | Account structure reserved; currency assigned, and ledger entry prepared. Awaiting KYC/KYB completion and internal compliance review. |
| Active   | Account verified and fully operational. The client (Business or Individual) can send and receive payments.                            |
| Closed   | Account manually closed due to offboarding, inactivity, compliance decision, or business termination.                                 |

Closing Path: Active → Closed (manual)

#### Account Creation Flow

To successfully create an account:

1. Customer must exist — only verified KYC/KYB customers are eligible.

2. Required fields:

    - `customer_id` — unique verified customer reference.
    - `currency` — supported currency code (ISO 4217).
    - `account_type` — individual or business.

3. Optional fields:

    - `metadata` — internal information (purpose, label, internal reference).

4. Validation:

    - Account cannot be duplicated for the same customer–currency pair.
    - Invalid or unsupported currency triggers `400 VALIDATION_ERROR`.

5. Result
    - On success, a new account object is created in a reserved inactive state, depending on the configuration.
    - After successful verification, the account transitions to or active.

#### Field Validation Requirements

| Field        | Type   | Required | Rules                                         |
|--------------|--------|----------|-----------------------------------------------|
| customer_id  | string |          | Must belong to an existing verified customer. |

#### Status Lifecycle Summary

| Phase       | Statuses Included | Notes                                                                  |

#### IBANs

Operations for issuing and managing IBANs linked to an account.

| Method | Endpoint                                                         | Description                                        |
|--------|------------------------------------------------------------------|----------------------------------------------------|
| POST   | [`/accounts/{id}/ibans`](../OpenAPI/accounts/issueNewIban)       | Issues a new IBAN linked to the specified account. |
| GET    | [`/accounts/{id}/ibans`](../OpenAPI/accounts/listIbansByAccount) | Returns all IBANs associated with the account.     |

IBANs are used to enable both incoming and outgoing payments for customer accounts.
Each issued IBAN is uniquely linked to an account and can be used to receive SEPA transfers or initiate outgoing payments under the same customer
profile.
IBANs are generated in the Finnish format and include the relevant BIC identifier for the PaySaxas payment network.

Each IBAN object contains structural and status information that allows clients to display and manage account identifiers within their own platforms.
All IBANs issued through the API are safeguarded under the same regulatory and reconciliation rules as customer accounts.

***Typical response fields include:***
    - iban — unique Finnish IBAN assigned to the account (e.g. FI2112345600000785)
    - bic — Bank Identifier Code (e.g. PAYSA0XXX)
    - currency — account currency (always "EUR")
    - status — current state of the IBAN (active, reserved, or closed)
    - created_at — timestamp of issuance in ISO 8601 format
Example payloads demonstrate both successful issuance and potential error cases, such as validation failures or duplicate requests.

```json
{
"iban": "FI2112345600000785",
"bic": "PAYSA0XXX",
"currency": "EUR",
"status": "active",
"created_at": "2025-01-15T10:00:00Z"
}
```

> IBAN and BIC are examples only — not real financial identifiers.
